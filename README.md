# ABC_Call_Volume_Trend_Analysis

In this project, we’ll be diving into the world of Customer Experience (CX) analytics, specifically 
focusing on the inbound calling team of a company. We have provided a dataset that spans 23 days 
and includes various details such as the agent's name and ID, the queue time (how long a customer 
had to wait before connecting with an agent), the time of the call, the duration of the call, and the 
call status (whether it was abandoned, answered, or transferred).
A Customer Experience (CX) team plays a crucial role in a company. They analyze customer feedback 
and data, derive insights from it, and share these insights with the rest of the organization. This team 
is responsible for a wide range of tasks, including managing customer experience programs, handling 
internal communications, mapping customer journeys, and managing customer data, among others.
One of the key roles in a CX team is that of the customer service representative, also known as a call 
center agent. These agents handle various types of support, including email, inbound, outbound, and 
social media support.
Inbound customer support, which is the focus of this project, involves handling incoming calls from 
existing or prospective customers. The goal is to attract, engage, and delight customers, turning 
them into loyal advocates for the business.
Advertising is a crucial aspect of any business. It helps increase sales and makes the audience aware 
of the company's products or services. The first impressions of a business are often formed through 
its advertising efforts.
The target audience for businesses can be local, regional, national, or international. Various types of 
advertising are used to reach these audiences, including online directories, trade and technical press, 
radio, cinema, outdoor advertising, and national papers, magazines, and TV.
The advertising business is highly competitive, with many players bidding large amounts of money to 
target the same audience segment. This is where the company's analytical skills come into play. The 
goal is to identify those media platforms that can convert audiences into customers at a low cost.
In this project, we’ll be using your analytical skills to understand the trends in the call volume of the 
CX team and derive valuable insights from it
